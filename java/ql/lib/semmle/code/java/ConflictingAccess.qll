  // We wish to find conflicting accesses that are reachable from public methods
  // and to know which monitors protect them.
  //
  // It is very easy and natural to write a predicate for conflicting accesses,
  // but that would be binary, and hence not suited for reachability analysis.
  //
  // It is also easy to state that all accesses to a field are protected by a single monitor,
  // but that would require a forall, which is not suited for recursion.
  // (The recursion occurs for example as you traverse the access path and keep requiring that all tails are protected.)
  //
  // We therefore use a dual solution:
  // - We write a unary recursive predicate for accesses that are not protected by any monitor.
  //   Any such write access, reachable from a public method, is conflicting with itself.
  //   And any such read will be conflicting with any publicly reachable write access (locked or not).
  //
  // - We project the above predicate down to fields, so we can find fields with unprotected accesses.
  // - From this we can derive a unary recursive predicate for fields whose accesses are protected by exactly one monitor.
  //   The predicate tracks the monitor.
  //   If such a field has two accesses protected by different monitors, we have a concurrency issue.
  //   This can be determined by simple counting at the end of the recursion.
  //   Technically, we only have a concurrency issue if there is a write access,
  //   but if you are locking your reads with different locks, you likely made a typo.
  //
  // - From the above, we can derive a unary recursive predicate for fields whose accesses are protected by at least one monitor.
  //   This predicate tracks all the monitors that protect accesses to the field.
  //   This is combined with a predicate that checks if any access escapes a given monitor.
  //   If all the monitors that protect accesses to a field are escaped by at least one access,
  //   we have a concurrency issue.
  //   This can be determined by a single forall at the end of the recursion.
  //
  // With this formulation we avoid binary predicates and foralls in recursion.
  //
  // Cases where a field access is not protected by any monitor
